# ///// Laser-Harp-Project\\\\\

# This project has Maked in collaboration with Frederic_Wauters, he help me to understand the principle work of the laser harp and in the arduino code 

# This repository is a Save of all of my research , test , version , of Laser Harp 

# /!\ The Light of Laser is very dangerous for the eyes , protect your eyes with a specific glass /!\

# This repository is , may be , not complet , but the principle ,schematics,code,plans is here to help you in this project 
# I have save the bases about Laser Harp , to you built your version of this mythic instrument 

# to make this version of laser harp you need some more component 

# Powerfull Laser Module (100mW minimum)
# Galvo Scanner (10KPPS minimum) 
# TL082 OP AMP
# LM393 OP AMP (Comparator)  
# MCP 4725 (of adafruit shield)
# TAOS TL257 (or equivalent)
# ATX power
# Arduino UNO/Mega 2560
# Potentiometer 10K
# Precise Protentiometer 10K and 100k
# some resistors (see in differrent schematics)
# some cable
# some pin connector mal/femal
# Solder BreadBoard or (prototype breadboard)

# for the sensor , I don't pulse my laser module , and in the schematics , you can delete filter part , ans save just comparator part
