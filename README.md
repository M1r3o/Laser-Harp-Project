This project was made in collaboration with Frederic_Wauters, Franck Morisseau A.K.A Genesis and Thomas Avisse, they helped me to understand the principle work of the laser harp . 

 This repository is a gather of all of my research, test , version, of Laser Harp     

/!\ The Light of Laser is very dangerous for the eyes, protect your eyes with a specific goggles /!\  

 This repository may not be complete but the main, schematics, code, plans and GERBER file is here to help you in this project.  

Disclaimer : some or any option ( example : strings vibration, RGB parametrable laser beam and the hand height) 
are inspired by french Laser Harp team : [there Laser Harp website](https://www.harpelaser.com) 
designed and conceived by (Franck Morisseau, Laurent Ma , and Other Laurent) 
But our electrical schematics, program, and pcb are not in relation with him and their team, just some option are inspired by their work 

Disclaimer #2 : WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BAD USAGE OF YOUR LASER, AND THIS REPOSITORY ARE NOT DELIVERED WITH ANY WARRANTY !!!

Thanks
