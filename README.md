This project is Made in collaboration with Frederic_Wauters, he helped me to understand the principle work of the laser harp and in the arduino code 

 This repository is a gather of all of my research, test , version, of Laser Harp     

/!\ The Light of Laser is very dangerous for the eyes, protect your eyes with a specific goggles /!\  

 This repository may not be complete but the main, schematics, code, plans is here to help you in this project   
 I have saved the bases about Laser Harp , to you built your version of this mythic instrument   

## Demo of Laser Harp
### [Demo Laser Harp](https://youtu.be/7bUMFFDsR9I)

## to make this version of laser harp you need some more component  
## -----------Laser---------------------------    
* ### Powerfull Laser Module (100mW minimum)  
## -----------To control Galva Scanner--------  
* ### Galvo Scanner (10KPPS minimum)   
* ### TL082 OP AMP  
* ### MCP 4725 (of adafruit shield)   
* ### some resistor (see in the schematics)  
* ### Precise Protentiometer 10K and 47k  
## -----------Sensor V1-----------------------
* ### LM393 or LM339  
* ### TAOS TSL257 (or equivalent)  
* ### Resistor 1K (see in schematics , this is an example , you can to employ diferent reistor , but you need to calcul consommation (mA) of your comparator system and arduino (Max 250mA for arduino)  
* ### Potentiometer 10K  
## -----------Another------------------------  
* ### ATX power  
* ### Arduino UNO/Mega 2560  
* ### some resistors (see in differrent schematics)  
* ### some cable  
* ### some pin connector mal/femal  
* ### Solder BreadBoard or (prototype breadboard)  
* ### USB MIDI Converter  
* ### USB B-Type Cable  
## --------------------------------------------  
* ### If you need help to search your different pieces in different internet site for laser Harp , you can to download this file -> "composant-harpe-laser.pdf"on different websites. of component you need for laser harp .
